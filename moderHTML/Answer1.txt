Some of the main features of HTML5 are as follows -
(a)- Simplified Doctype: 
    HTML5 uses a simplified, consistent <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, making it easier to start coding web pages.

(b)- Semantic Elements: HTML5 introduces a range of semantic elements like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <article>, and more, allowing developers to structure web content more meaningfully.

(c)- Multimedia Support:<audio> and <video> elements:
   (1)- HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content, reducing the reliance on third-party plugins like Flash.
   (2)- <canvas> element: It enables the drawing of graphics, animations, and interactive applications directly in the browser, suitable for games and other visual applications.

(d)-Form Enhancements:
    (a)-New input types: HTML5 introduces new input types like email, url, number, date, and range, improving the user experience and making form validation easier.
    (b)- Form elements: Features like the <datalist> element for autocompletion and <output> element for displaying calculation results are introduced to improve form functionality.

(e)-Local Storage: HTML5 provides localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, allowing web applications to store data locally on the user's device, which is useful for creating offline-capable apps.

(f)- Geolocation: HTML5 offers the Geolocation API, allowing web applications to access the user's geographical location, enabling location-based services and maps.

(g)- Web Storage: HTML5 introduces a client-side storage mechanism that allows for more efficient data storage and retrieval than traditional cookies.
